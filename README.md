# Cinemation (W.I.P.)

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/xy3ldosh58v7y5ea?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Cinemation/cinemation)

Cinemation ("CMT") aims to make it easier to download movies. You can add movies to a "wanted" list and CMT will keep looking for it on the enabled indexers. Once the correct file has been found it will download it. 

It's also possible to download a lower quality version first (720p) and then automatically upgrade to a higher quality (1080p). After downloading the higher quality version it will remove the old one.

*If you're looking to download TV Series, I recommend looking into [Sonarr][sonarr].*

## Indexers

"Indexers" are the torrent sites CMT uses to search for movies. You can enable and disable the ones you like or dislike. 

*If you want a specific indexer added, create an [issue][create_issue] and make sure you can send an invite if it's a private tracker.*
